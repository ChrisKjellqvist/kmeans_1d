/**
 * This test is designed to produce and then attempt to escape from a degenerate placement caused by a greedy
 * local placement.
 *
 * The problem is as follows (K = 2):
 * Consider a distribution with two primary peaks, one at -2, and one at 2. However, the magnitude of the peak at 2
 * is much smaller than the peak at -2. On the first iteration of the algorithm the means are set to be equally
 * spread over the data. If the spread of the data is very large compared to the spread of the peaks, then an initial
 * placement of the means may be such that the second mean is placed PAST the second peak. Then, when considering
 * where to place mean_0 between the leftmost datapoint and mean_1, the algorithm will place it at the second peak
 * because magnitude is overwhelming. Then, when attempting to place mean_1, we only consider between mean_0 and the
 * rightmost datapoint, ignoring the possibility of placing it at the first peak.
 *
 * We're going to try to escape this by using a global placement after finding a locally converged placement. If
 * this is not enough to converge to an optimal solution in all cases, then mean placement is non-convex and this
 * entire algorithm will not work. There is potential hope for doing a non-optimal placement and then hoping that its
 * converged loss will be less than the loss of the originally locally stable solution but again this would
 * imply that mean placement is non-convex in which case the best we'll be able to accomplish is "heuristic" k-means.
